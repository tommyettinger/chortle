This is closely based on
[iibrahimbakr's libGDX-RTL-Language repo](https://github.com/iibrahimbakr/libGDX-RTL-Language),
which is also licensed under the Apache License v2.0 . Some changes have been applied to that
repo, ranging from optimizations to making LTR text (including digits and Latin/Greek/Cyrillic-script
text) able to be placed inside blocks of Arabic text while keeping the LTR text's word order as LTR.
